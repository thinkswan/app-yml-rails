# Note: Settings from the current environment (test/development/staging/production) will override settings

# Example: The following config will result in this resultant hash: App.emails = { :admin => 'admin@localhost', :support => 'support@example.com' }
#
# all:
#   emails:
#     admin: admin@example.com
#     support: support@example.com
# development:
#   emails:
#     admin: admin@localhost
#
# In this example, 'App.emails.admin' will return 'admin@localhost'.
